1.0.1
Removed core as a requirment

Improved folder structure

1.1.2
Improved folder structure drasticly
Added link to about file (currently only goes to steam page, will one day probaly link to a wiki (most likley using github)
added version number to about file (to be precise, 1.1.2)
Removed SuperEngie and DopeUnicorn909 as authors, leaving just The Dynamic Trio and CTH2004. The reason is that, while both of them are part of "the Dynamic Trio", I'm the only one making this specific mod. So, they are included in "The Dynamic Trio" as they do help, but since they aren't making code additions, it's mostly by me right now. Once they have rimworld and we begin to work together on it, they shall be back!

1.1.3
Added a load before and load after to ensure this is always below frameworks, in case this ever performs patches on them.
Altered description
Set up wiki

added a highly recommended mods discussion

1.2.1
fixed the lists (background)
published it correctly via publisher plus (apparently some genius forgot it wasn't enabled... not going to name names, CTH2004
added a folder to do something with publisher plus easier

v 2.0.0
change ID (mod breaking)
update to 1.5 as well (compatible with both, excluding the fact that some of the requirments aren't updated)
Updated mod lists to reflect new ID's

v2.0.1
updated some requirments
removed outdated requirment
put better mod in
started moveing some things around in background

v2.0.2
updated changelog for entire mod
changed version number from 2.0.0
fixed a link

fixed a requirment I'd mistyped

v2.0.3
updated other mods, and added their new lists
fixed an issue with my comments, so that red error (should) be gone (Famous last words, am I right)
put all my old, half finished mods into a folder (along with some notes), so I can slowly transfer the features. If you go to my mod, you can manually take the contents out. They work, but have very few features. I have a note in each one saying which mod(s) I currently plan on mergeing it with, so you can look and get a general idea of some future updates!
Added all of my mods to the mod lists

v2.0.4
added a spreadsheet that can check to see if an items description is past steams maximum (or what I think it is)
	Technically not important, as it isn't uploaded to steam, and is only on github. But, it is a change
added in finalized lists for OP Thingamajing Mod (and published it)
moved lists into a folder of "CHTechIndustries Mods", and added a folder for framework examples (frameworks that have an example included)

added other frameworks into the "load order", for future reference/ reminding me of future ideas/ just to keep them in a logical place
improved folder structure

v2.0.5
removed tabula rausa
drasticly improved description
added a line about support of CE to FAQ
added tabula rausa to "Recommended Mods" (and note: it might become a dependency again)
add mod icon
mentioned a few more highly recomended mods

continued to try to get Publisher+ working, so extraneus files don't bog down the downloads
	tried moving folders
	tried removing a folder that contained old about files (shouldn't cause an issue but worth a try)
	copied another mods functional one into it, and added in the extra folders so no changes to it was necessary
still not working, reporting to moder. so, not quite optimized file, not too bad though

v2.0.6
fixed my mistake that made Publisher+ not work. It was a stupid mistake, I dare say...
	to do it, I've removed the 1.4 archive mod lists, and removed the lists from the 1.5 folder
	Sortened the CHTechIndustries section to CHTech

v2.0.7
modified so about file has less extraneus parts, and made notes
added a mention of un-un-limmited, and recommended it
added un-un-limmited to order

v2.0.8
added in the code of un-un-limmited (with permission and credit)
removed Tweaks Galore (will be a soft compat)
update all lists
altered about file to include credit to the autor of un-un-limmited
altered description for same reason
removed unecessary "do not upload" entry
fixed gramaticall issues in authors section
found a way to make "authors" and "contributers" slightly seperate (multiple lines), so did that
made incompatible with those unlimiter mods, as they are redundent, and therefore at worst will cause crashes, quite likley cause issues of some sort, and at best are still redundent

v2.0.9
made it load What's That Mod bellow this one
added Tabula Rasa based change log (much, much harder than expected)
made it require Tabula Rasa (sorry, there's a lot of features there)
re-designed mod list system (in background)
improved load order
slightly altered about file
started using "releases" in github, so that will be the links from now on
due to how I don't fully remember the logs, and some issues in my logs (inconsistancies), everything before this (2.0.9) isn't 100% correct with the in-game log, as I had to guestimate some (especially between 1.1.0 and 2.0.0)

v2.0.10
Slightly altered folder structure for better changelog posistioning
