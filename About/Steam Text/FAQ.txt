Q: CE Compatible?
A: Uh... sure. There might be "unintented features" that we can't guarentee to fix, but you do you and all!

Q: I have increased my pawns max nutrition, but it doesn't seem to have much effect. Why?
A: After a certain point, Rimworld has issues going above certain values with stats. To counteract it, I recommend using [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2566316158]Need Bar Overflow[/url] by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198134085825/myworkshopfiles/?appid=294100]AmCh[/url]

Q: I made a carnivore, but they can't eat baby food! Why, and what should I do?
A: Once again, it's rimworlds fault. Baby Food is made of plants, so if a pawn can't digest plants, they can't digest baby food. Steam user [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198013052731/myworkshopfiles/?appid=294100]StarkRavingSane[/url] made a mod called [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2998479989]Meaty Baby Food[/url] that lets you make baby food from meat. Due to it's design, there will be no incompatibilities!

Q: I want a way to make one baby food that all my babies can eat!
A: Well then, try [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2934118873]BK's Babies can eat Nutrient Paste[/url] by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198376086085/myworkshopfiles/?appid=294100]Brent Kerman[/url], which works wonderfully with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2920385763]Vanilla Nutrient Paste Expanded[/url]

Q: without a major source of food poisioning for my carnivorous babies, it feels too easy! What should I do?
A: Well, how about making food poisioning lethal, so that when you give the wrong food to your babies, or have a bad chef, it can be lethal? If that sounds nice, try [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2646630077]Lethal Food Poisoning[/url] by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Argon4/myworkshopfiles/?appid=294100]Arg√≥n[/url]

Q: Some of the xenos have very small icons (gizmos) for the abilities, why's that and what should I do?
A: When you have a lot of gizmos, the game will scale them down. It becomes a major issue when you have lots of abilities via complex xenotypes, or worse, complex xenotypes with lots of psycasts. To counteract it, you can try [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2838035829]Scrollable Gizmos[/url] by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/2blockdude/myworkshopfiles/?appid=294100]2blockdude[/url]. The changes and necesary scrolling takes some getting used to however, and isn't for everyone.

Q: My xeno that should be very OP is surprisingly under-powered! Why?
A: Rimworld limits many values, so to unlock the full potential of your ultra-xeno, you will need so-called "unlimiter mods". Already one has been mentioned (Need bar Overflow), but you will also probally want:
	1. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1668141382]Un-Limited[/url] by Grimm to allow percentages to go above normal, such as inate armour above 200%.
	2. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2880595382]Limitless Deathrest[/url] by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198094534855/myworkshopfiles/?appid=294100]DemonX3[/url] for your extra-OP sangophages
	3. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2566316158]Need Bar Overflow[/url] by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198134085825/myworkshopfiles/?appid=294100]AmCh[/url]

Q: My OP xeno is getting killed by another OP xeno, even though the injury that appears after death doesn't look that bad. Why?
A: Rimworld, for reasons unknown, has a "Lethal Damage Threshold". If a pawn gets that much damage, it doesn't matter what part is destroyed, they die. It could only remove a toe, but they would still die. You can use the mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2657551690]No More Lethal Damage Threshold[/url] by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198095351210/myworkshopfiles/?appid=294100]Jdalt40[/url] to at least help counteract that, but it still isn't enough sometimes.

Q: Why is this incompatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2909758050]DBHGenes in xenotypes[/url] by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199007815912/myworkshopfiles/?appid=294100]SariusSkelrets[/url]?
A: Simple. Those mods are patches, and this mod will end up overwriting those ones.

Q: Why is this mod incompatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2995911252]Phytokin have Natural Connection[/url] by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/unix22b/myworkshopfiles/?appid=294100]Moka[/url]?
A: Same as the DBHGenes one

Q: So, is that why it's incompatible [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2976573675]Integrated Lovin' and Fertility Genes[/url] by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/alite/myworkshopfiles/?appid=294100]Alite[/url]?
A: Not quite. Integrated Lovin' and Fertility requires a specific gene ID, which is included in one of the 2 "all in 1 mods". However, it checks for the individual 2, meaning it throws errors unless you use each module. Then, my patch would end up overwriting it, same as above. Because of that, it is incompatible. Basicly, 2 reasons, one of which is the same as the previous 2 incompatibilities.
