A simple core for all mods by The Dynamic Trio!
Designed to add small fixes, centralize code that is useful for our mods, and ensure certain load orders are enforced

This mod is a very, very simple core for all mods by The Dynamic Trio!

What it does is ensure mods that are needed for all other mods are loaded, so we don't have to mark mods like [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2023507013]Vanilla Expanded Framework[/url] as a requirment, Vanilla Expanded Framework is already there, so we don't have to make the others force-install it!

It also includes some general XML patches (well, will), and some pieces of code for all the other mods.

FAQ
Q: CE Compatible?
A: Uh... sure. There might be "unintented features" (especially as more code is added) that we can't guarentee to fix, but you do you and all!

Q: Why does this mod need [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2009463077]Harmony[/url]
A: Harmony is a library with lots of useful, powerful, code. There is a reason most mods either require it, or require a framework that requires it. Even if I didin't need it, Vanilla Expanded Framework does, so either way you'll need it!

Q: Okay, so why is Vanilla Expanded Framework required?
A: Once again, lots of useful code, and it's very, very helpful. Without it, many mods would be impossible. Not to mention, lots of my mods require mods that, you guessed it, requires Vanilla Expanded Framework!

Q: Okay, fair enough. So, why does it need [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2574315206]XML Extensions[/url]?
A: Once again, lots of very useful code. It allows for things like mod settings via XML, not coding, as well as much more complex, dynamic patches. Eventually, as I get better with it, it will easily decrease the complexity of patches in my mods.

Q: So, you have explained the others, but why is [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2873415404]Log Publisher from HugsLib[/url] required?
A: Well, this one is less important. Technecially speaking, it's not used. But, the log publisher is [i]very[/i] useful for people sending bug reports. So, this is a requirment to ensure people have it availiable. So, you could run this core without it just fine, so long as you are okay with errors, and not being able to properly report bugs!

Q: Why is this FAQ in the form of more like a conversation?
A: Not sure, but who cares! Obviously you had no issue, as you got down to here!

Q: Okay, after reading all these, I have to ask, are you okay? Like, mentally?
A: No. No I am not. I am definitly insane. Thanks for asking!
