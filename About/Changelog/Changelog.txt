Pre-releases (before any releases, and therefore version number, so instead just an indented list, each new sublist being due to some reason (previously new commits, now dates.

"0." (before I made this file)
	1. made mod
	2. made 2 android genes that worked, then didnt, then...
	3. made expirmental genes for another mod in (weeks ato)
	4. moved those to this mod
	5. made another mod (that I plan on moving)
	6. couldnt get a gene to inherit properties
	7. realized theres a lot of commits, and made a change log.
1. 22/11/2023
	1. Initial Changelog Upload (see commits for any changes before this)
2. 22/11/2023
	1. Added link to the folder with all links: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17W31dHYpdEOISV22GKUj4Fy8HWRZvpLs?usp=sharing
3. 22/11/2023
	1. Removed changelog.md as it was redundent
	2. Made a note to somehow automate these changelogs
	3. Removed non-necessary/ redundant shortcuts
	4. Tested Excell-based changelog
	5. Made Shortcut to Excel-based Changelog (not in main changelog folder, will be moved if this is a valid method)
4. 22/11/2023
	1. Improved the wording on the first changelog entry (0.0.1)
	2. Moved the excell spreadsheet elsewhere, as it seems to be worth looking into, but lower priority so it needen't be with the main stuff
5. 23/11/2023
	1. Made it require a couple mods that improve some of the others (Unlimited Armour, Need Bar Overflow), and mentioned a useful mod (Scrollable Gizmos) in the about file
	2. Slightly improved about file's text
	3. Made notes of where xenotypes, custom ideologies, and custom androids are stored
	4. Fixed some date errors in changelog
	5. Tried to figure out how I should version it, couldn't figure it out, decided to continue with how I am. Once I understand "semantic versiononing" and "github" enough to properly use it, I will make a note and start using that versioning system. In essense, the final number (the "z" in x.y.z is for small patches. But, what I'm doing has it where even small updateds can cause major changes... so, what do you do? Having a 0.x.y means "alpha, unstable", but the website didin't go into more info... decided "deal with later")
	6. Decided to probaly completley scrap the Excell built-in changelog, as that seems to cause strange effects on github. Will probaly make something like that published elsewhere, where this file is for quick "this was changed. that was changed. this minute thing changed". The spreadsheet is for "these 5 features where added". Basicly, this file is all info, that sheet is the summary of noticible changes (not, say, a change to a mispelled date in the changelog)
	For instance, with update 0.0.3 and 0.0.4, no changes truly occured besides minor back-end changes, so it would only show "minor changes" or some such on the sheet. And, on entry 5 with version 0.0.5 (this one), this sheet might show the names (and maybe a list of genes), but the "main log" (spreadsheet) will show in-depth info like genes and such. If one of those xenos change in another version, the spreadsheet says which was removed, which was added, and the new list. This document would say "removed x, y, and z. Added a, and b")
	7. Added Numbers to each entry to the changelogs.
	8. Made some notes
	9. Added link shortcuts to a folder that isn't shared, to make a note of the links incase needed
	10. Figured out that the android genes are much more complex, so decided that I will deal with them later (added note, might make a folder name-change)
	11. added issue templates
	12. continuly improved said templates
	13. made it suggest useing discord via a "config.yml"
	14. made a wiki on github, relized i didint have anthy of note yet, so removed it.
6. 24/11/2023
	1. Fixed a date in this file
	2. improved issues file
	3. realized this isnt truly a "version" yet, so removed version numbers
	4. mentioned some things that occured pre-changelog, but relized they arent realy major, so only put some in and called it quits
	5. worked on presets some more
	6. made 2 branches for changelog and preset improvments (respectiy)
	7. tried to make a more "protected" release branch
	8. decided to wait until said branch is needed
	9. made a note about future plan for a templaye
	10. made that template minus the one planned feature
	11. Updated Changelog
	12. Merged Changelog
	13. Finished templates
	14. merged templates
