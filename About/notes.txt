Note to self: if PublisherHelper is removed, the original has probaly been updated, so get it from here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1510554297
Note to self: check every so often if PublisherHelper (original) is updated, and if so, find out if that means the 1.4 port will no longer recieve updateds. If so, transistion to the original

consider splitting into multiple mods? Make more "modular"?

Make not need genetic natural focus mod, but do it internally

Changelog will slow down with versions once I learn how to use github releases. Then, text lines will be added in paragraphs for each "batch"

(few days worth) of code, and a "version" per each publish. Untill then, each "batch" is a new version.

Changelog might eventually go through a major re-write, such as me adding earlier changes to it (includeing updates before when I started the file), and (eventually) changing the version numbers inside. Right now, those numbers are "notes", once I use github-releases and have "official" releace versions, then I will go through and make the versions match that, (and, once that hapens, convention prevents any more edits of previous entries, but right now it's more just notes than a true changelog)
