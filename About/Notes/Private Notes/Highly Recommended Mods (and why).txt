This is a list of mods that work very well with this mod (my other mods might also work great with another group, which will be mentioned in that mod). Also, if the mod is bolded, that means I consider it a near-necesity for useage

this mod allows you to have pawns not waste nutrition when the food would put them a little over 100%, and makes other sources of increased max nutrition work better

not sure if it's necessary, but (unless you have Super Hero Genes (which is an optional dependency of my gene mod)), it's unknown if Un-Limmited also affects armour (I've gotten conflicting answers. Primarily "no". However, it might be a simple xml patch, in which case I might do it eventually)

this way, if you get too many gizmos because of mods, you can scroll!
