A simple core for all mods by CHTechIndustries!
Designed to add small fixes, centralize code that is useful for our mods, and ensure certain load orders are enforced

This mod is a very, very simple core for all mods by The Dynamic Trio!

What it does is ensure mods that are needed for all other mods are loaded, so we don't have to mark mods like [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2023507013]Vanilla Expanded Framework[/url] as a requirment, Vanilla Expanded Framework is already there, so we don't have to make the others force-install it!

It also includes some general XML patches (well, will), and some pieces of code for all the other mods.

Also, the following mods are highly encouraged: [list]

FAQ
Q: CE Compatible?
A: Uh... sure. There might be "unintented features" (especially as more code is added) that we can't guarentee to fix, but you do you and all!

Q: Why does this mod need [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2009463077]Harmony[/url]
A: Harmony is a library with lots of useful, powerful, code. There is a reason most mods either require it, or require a framework that requires it. Even if I didin't need it, Vanilla Expanded Framework does, so either way you'll need it!

Q: Okay, so why is Vanilla Expanded Framework required?
A: Once again, lots of useful code, and it's very, very helpful. Without it, many mods would be impossible. Not to mention, lots of my mods require mods that, you guessed it, requires Vanilla Expanded Framework!

Q: Okay, fair enough. So, why does it need [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2574315206]XML Extensions[/url]?
A: Once again, lots of very useful code. It allows for things like mod settings via XML, not coding, as well as much more complex, dynamic patches. Eventually, as I get better with it, it will easily decrease the complexity of patches in my mods.

Q: Alright, so why do you have [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1660622094]Tabula Rausua[/url] as a requriment?
A: Well, two reasons. The first is that it's a soft (recommended) requirment of another mod, which I suspect you'll be asking in the next question. The other is it's a framework that I might use, and since something else can use it... 

Q: Why exactly is [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2695164414]Tweaks Galore[/url] there?
A: Well, I used to recommend a different mod, but this one has more features and is more robust. It does require you to manually enable it, but it has the ability to turn off Lethal Damage Threshold, which is highly recommended. (a future update will make settings default to those, and might remove the Unlimited requirment)

Q: Did you recommend those mods in the "highly encouraged" area for similar resons?
A: Wow, your getting good at this! Yes, I did.those mods, while the efect isn't enough to be worthy of a requirment, cause enough of a benifit that they are, in a way "pseudo-requriments". For more info (i'm still working on the title and text), see [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/3097014712/4289187621815128945/]Here[/url]

Q: Why is this FAQ in the form of more like a conversation?
A: Not sure, but who cares! Obviously you had no issue, as you got down to here!

Q: Okay, after reading all these, I have to ask, are you okay? Like, mentally?
A: No. No I am not. I am definitly insane. Thanks for asking!

Q: Oh, just remembered, if things become more broken than normal, how should I report it?!
A: well, just put it in either the comments or the relevant discussion. Please include a log from either [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=818773962]Hugs Lib[/url] or [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2873415404]Log Publisher from Hugs Lib[/url]. The first one is a library, the second one was made in 1.4 when Hugs Lib's log publisher didin't work. Doesn't matter which
