This is a list of mods that work very well with this mod (my other mods might also work great with another group, which will be mentioned in that mod). Also, if the mod is bolded, that means I consider it a near-necesity for useage

this allows you to see my mods updates, and is a soft compat of Tweaks Galore. Also, (might) one day be used as a soft compat for my other mods.
