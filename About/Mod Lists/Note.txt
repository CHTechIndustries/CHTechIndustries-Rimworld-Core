1. unless specified, the mod has the "assistance" mods

2. the list in this folder contains the mods used for debugging/ publishing

3. the debug mods haven't been optimized for newest version, so right now a mod with only my mods is there, so "Sort" can be used to add in the pre-reqs, as they change. Once finilized, will remove that and make it the main one
